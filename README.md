# Chip-8 Rust emulator


This is an emulator written for the [Chip-8](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) written in Rust,
marking the third step of my _Rust auditor_ journey.

If you are doing something similar to me in Rust learning and programming at whole
I would say this project is perfect for you, *if you have previous experience with programming*
