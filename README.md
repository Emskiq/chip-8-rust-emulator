# Chip-8 Rust emulator

Yet another [Chip-8](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator written in Rust, marking the third step of my _Rust auditor_ journey. This project is following the previous [PngMe](https://github.com/Emskiq/pngme/tree/main) project, which actually suggested doing this emulator.

I would say this project is perfect for you, *if you have previous experience with programming*. [Laurence Muller](https://multigesture.net/about/) couldn't summurize it better in his [blogpost](https://multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/)<br>
- _Donâ€™t use this project as a way to learn how to program. (If bitwise operations confuse you, study them first)_

(however be prepared for long resaerch if you haven't done this type of projects
